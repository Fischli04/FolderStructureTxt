# FolderStructureTxt

This Repo converts a folder structure to a visual text overview with Icons. 

Example:

```
┣📁 Folder1
┃┗📁 Folder3

┣📁 Folder2

┗📄 File.txt
```

## Instructions

At first you have to create a folder structure in the `FolderStructure` Folder.

Then you can run `Generate.ps1`, this generates a file, named by the timestamp, in an `out` folder. You can now copy the content of it and paste it wherever you want.
